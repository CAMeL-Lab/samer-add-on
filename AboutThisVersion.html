<!-- SAMER Interface version 0.7.0 -->

<!-- What's New: -->
<!-- - Changed "More solutions" to display lemmas in Arabic rather than Buckwalter
    - Completely changed the UI and divided the sidebar into two sections: doc-level analysis and word-level analysis
    - User can toggle each section to hide it from view
    - sidebar header now takes up less space
    - Added document-level analysis by type (unique lemmas). User can switch between analysis by token and by type through the sidebar.
    - Added a feature that suggests hypernyms, synonyms, and antonyms with a lower level than the current lemma to support simplification
