<!-- SAMER Interface version 0.7.1 -->

<!-- What's New: -->
<!-- - Added "Show Markup" feature to show level markup in the form of '#level#'' in front of every word. This will allow users to copy their documents from one version of the tool to another version without changing their existing level assignments
    - Added "Hide markup" feature to hide the level markup in front of each word by reducing the font size to 1
    - Added "clear markup" feature to complete strip away all the level markup from the document
    - Changed word/document selection such that the tool automatically expands the user's selection to the word's boundaries and searches for existing level assignments ('#level#') around the word.
